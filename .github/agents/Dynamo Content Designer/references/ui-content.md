# UI Content

User interface content is a cornerstone of our products. Our word choices affect how a product is used, and how a product is used affects our word choices.

Creating high-quality content takes more than just good writing. In addition, text strings must be actionable, consistent, and presented so that users can accomplish their tasks as quickly as possible.

UI content can include:

- Error messages
- Notifications
- Labels
- Tooltips

## Guidelines for Writing UI Content

### 1. Clarity over Complexity

**Simplify complexity without losing meaning.**

**Why it matters**  
Clarity is more important than brevity. Clear and concise content reduces cognitive load and frustration, and helps people complete tasks faster.

**What it drives**  
Ease of use

**How to apply it**

- Use plain language, break down complex workflows into manageable steps, and remove unnecessary jargon
- Prioritize understanding over technical detail
- Don't assume people understand technical terms

### 2. Helpful and Actionable

**Guide users toward action and success.**

**Why it matters**  
Usable is more important than being technically precise. Content should help people complete tasks efficiently.

**What it drives**  
Speed

**How to apply it**

- Design for maximum usability and accessibility
- Ensure people always know what to do next
- Use progressive disclosure and show essential content first, giving options to see more details if needed
- Use content patterns and terminology consistently across all touch points

### 3. Trustworthy and Transparent

**Be transparent and show empathy for people's goals and frustrations.**

**Why it matters**  
Long term trust wins over short-term gain. Transparent communication reduces friction and builds positive relationships with people.

**What it drives**  
Trust

**How to apply it**

- Use supportive language
- Offer solutions and make people feel in control and that their goals are being prioritized

#### Build and Maintain Trust

- Give users clear choices and control
- Be transparent about data use and product behavior
- Use a consistent and reliable voice across the product

#### Be Clear and Concise

- Keep content brief, scannable, and to the point
- Use visual hierarchy to guide attention, such as headers
- Write only what's necessary—every word should support the user experience

#### Design for the User

- Use plain language and limit jargon
- If technical terms are necessary, use them only when they aid clarity
- Avoid internal terminology that users won't understand

### 4. Use Active, Direct Language

- Use active voice over passive unless it's to quickly summarize an event
- Speak directly to users using "you" and "your"
- Minimize first-person usage unless taking ownership or making a clear commitment

**Exception for passive voice**  
Use passive voice to quickly summarize an event when needed.

### 5. Trust the UX

- Don't add content if the design communicates effectively on its own
- Simplify whenever possible to reduce cognitive load

### 6. Guide Proactively

- Know the user's flow and provide content that supports it at each step
- Use progressive disclosure—give the right information at the right time, and reveal more as needed
- Start with what matters most (the "why"), then explain the "how"

### 7. Design for Accessibility and Inclusivity

- Follow or exceed WCAG AA standards
- Use inclusive, respectful language that considers all users
- Keep language simple and clear for global audiences
- Aim for a Flesch-Kincaid readability score of 70–80, or grade level 7–8
- Avoid idioms, clichés, slang, or region-specific phrases
- Improve clarity by using simple language that supports localization for non-native English speakers
