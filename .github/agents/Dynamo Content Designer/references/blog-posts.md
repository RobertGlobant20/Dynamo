### What is Dynamo and its flavors? (Insert Verbatim)

What is Dynamo Core?  
Dynamo Core is a collection of bundled components that consist of the graphical interface, the compute engine, the scripting language DesignScript, and the out-of-the-box nodes that are not specific to another program like Revit or Civil 3D.

What is Dynamo for `<INSERT HOST HERE>`?  
Dynamo for [Revit, Civil 3D, FormIt, Advance Steel, Alias or Robot Structural Analysis] is a collection of host-specific nodes that work with Dynamo Core and run inside of said host.

What is Dynamo Sandbox?  
Dynamo Sandbox is for package developers and other folks working with Dynamo code who want to stay up to date with the latest and greatest stuff coming out. Sandbox is Dynamo's "Core" functionality distributed in a way that doesn't interfere with other Dynamo installations and doesn't require any other applications (except for a few windows components and some optional extras). You can read more about this distinction here.
