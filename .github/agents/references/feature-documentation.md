## Tone guidance

### Keep it simple

Imagine that you are writing for someone who is smart but who does not necessarily have a strong grasp of English. This person often reads English sentences word by word.

To help this reader, use simple language and clear expression:

- Use common words (aim for words understood by most 12-year-olds).
- Define technical terms.
- Avoid jargon, idioms, and humor.
- Strive for clarity and a complete lack of ambiguity.
- Don’t sacrifice clarity for elegant style. Short, choppy sentences are fine.
- Don’t use synonyms in the service of stylistic variation. Users may think that you’re making a subtle distinction. Use one word and stick to it.

Keep the structure simple, too:

- Concentrate on procedural organization.
- Flatten the structure, minimizing hierarchical and design elements.

### Keep it short

Use short sentences. Use simple subject-object structures, and avoid long clauses. Don’t use the subjunctive mood (change “The dialog requires that the user enter a valid value” to “Enter a valid value” or “The value must be valid”).

Delete unnecessary words. You reduce Autodesk localization costs, and you save the user time.

Yes: When Java asks permission to run, select Run This Time.  
No: When the “Java needs your permission to run” message displays at the top of the browser, select “Run this time.”

Short trumps perfect. When necessary, break style conventions that lead to empty words. For example, to shorten, you can ignore the convention that list items must be either all fragments or all full sentences. Also, shield the user from unnecessary details and complexity.

Single-source it. Don’t repeat the same thing in different contexts. Eliminate redundant text of more than a sentence or two.

One way. Document only one way to perform a task. For example, don’t document various ways to zoom, and don’t give keyboard shortcuts in addition to UI instructions.  
Exception: If the way to perform a task is different in two different application contexts, document both.

Not an encyclopedia. Abandon the encyclopedic approach. Don’t document self-evident options, trivial tasks easily inferred from tooltips, or operating system tasks and conventions.

No introduction necessary. Delete topic introductions that restate the title in different words. Similarly, don’t add a shortdesc (short description) element that restates the title.

Limit visuals. Make sure that illustrations and videos serve a learning purpose. Use them to enrich rather than repeat the text. Don’t use an illustration for what you can describe briefly in text. For more information, see Screenshots and illustrations and Videos and screen motion captures.
